Our game is a spin-off of the popular internet game, Fishy, except that we allow for two players to play at once, and we have a designated stopping point for the game. The two players are the cartoon fish on the screen, and compete against one another to eat the most fish and accumulate points before the fish run out. The catch, however, is that a player can only eat a fish that is smaller than itself-- after eating several fish of one size, the player grows and can then eat larger fish. The sharks are the only fish that cannot be eaten. If at any point a player collides with a fish larger than itself or a shark, the game ends and that player loses. Once all the fish are eaten, the game ends and the player with the most points wins.

To play the game, run master.py from one machine and then client.py from another. The game screens will appear, and you can play!
